South African opposition politician‚ advocate Dali Mpofu‚ is celebrating his son Sizwe’s graduation with a Masters degree from prestigious Oxford University. “?Arrived in Oxford for the graduation ceremony tomorrow @SizweMW... M Phil with Distinction! #ProudDad #RhodesMustFallOxford‚” the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) chairperson tweeted today (30 July 2015). Legal colleague Vusi Pikoli ?@VusiPikoli‚ the former national prosecutions boss‚ sent his good wishes‚ saying “@AdvDali–Mpofu @SizweMW congratulations broer and well done Sizwe!” Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh first hailed his achievement on Facebook earlier this month‚ sharing his excitement and thanking his parents. He posted: “Oxford MPhil with distinction‚ and a distinction on the thesis! Dedicate this to my mum‚ dad‚ amazing wife‚ big brothers‚ friends and other family. Thanks for your unwavering support over the last two years! ?#?BlackExcellence? ?#?MarksMustNotFall? grin emoticon”. Congratulatory messages to him included “So well deserved. I am so inspired by you” from Zuleyka Cherry‚ “...and we learn and we build and we grow...Salute!” from Sekese Rasephei. Theophilus Theofreshness Mokgatlhe posted “More than just a rhyming pretty face. Lol! smile emoticon” while Zweli King Dlomo shared his aspirations for Mpofu-Walsh‚ stating “#FuturePresident!!!” Mpofu-Walsh matriculated from St John’s College before studying for his honours degree in Politics‚ Philosophy and Economics at the University of Cape Town‚ where he was the Student Representative Council president. Last year‚ he famously (or infamously) wrote a hip hop song entitled Mr President‚ directed at President Jacob Zuma‚ saying it was time for social change and including the lyrics “Your time is up”. This year‚ he was instrumental in bringing the “Rhodes Must Fall” movement from UCT to Oxford university in Britain‚ setting up a student chapter to campaign against Cecil John Rhodes and the removal of colonial iconography on any of its campuses.
