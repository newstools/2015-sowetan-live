A TAXI driver who won the first round in a traditional leadership wrangle in court says he is looking forward to quitting his job and taking up his position as chief. The Thohoyandou High Court dismissed an application by the Tshivhulana royal family that sought to nullify the recognition of Norman Netshivhulana as headman. Instead, the royal family opted to have his uncle, Davhana Elias Netshivhulana, popularly known as Ed Max, installed as headman. Davhana took up the reigns as acting headman in 1993 after the death of Wilson Netshimbupfe the previous year. Last year, Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha issued Norman Netshivhulana, the first-born son of the dead headman, with a certificate as headman and cancelled that of Davhana . This resulted in a court challenge by the Netshivhulana Royal Council. But this was dismissed by Judge VV Tlhapi on Friday, with each party having to pay its own costs. The judge said it was premature to bring the matter to court before other avenues were exhausted.
