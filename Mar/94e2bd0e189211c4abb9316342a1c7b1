One of the parents in the baby swap case wants to consult a psychologist and a traditional healer about the child he is raising, The Star reported on Tuesday. The parties appeared before a full bench of three judges in the High Court in Pretoria on Monday to decide on a report by Prof Ann Skelton of the Centre for Child Law. She investigated the case, and together with three of the parents and experts recommended that each child remain with the family who raised them. The fourth parent, a father, said he had never met his biological daughter, nor did he take part in the therapy sessions as others did, according to the report. He asked the court to postpone the case for three months as he wanted to consult his own psychologist and a traditional expert. The father said the son he was raising had to undergo certain cultural rituals, but did not know how to go about the matter as he is Zulu and the son was of a different culture. He wanted advice from an expert in this regard. The children, a boy and a girl, would turn five in August. Two East Rand mothers learnt their babies were swapped in 2010 at the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Boksburg. This emerged when one of the mothers tried to claim maintenance from the man she believed was her son's father. Paternity tests revealed that not only was he not the boy's father, but she was not his mother.
