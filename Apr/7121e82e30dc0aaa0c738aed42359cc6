Violent anti-Semitic attacks soared by 38 percent worldwide in 2014 according to an Israeli survey marking 70 years since the liberation of the Nazi death camps. The Tel Aviv University study, which was published as Israel marked Holocaust memorial day on Thursday, said that figures from France and Britain were particularly disturbing. Across the world it logged 766 violent attacks, including "arson, vandalism or direct threats against Jewish persons or institutions". "In this regard 2014 has been the second-worst year of the decade, coming next after 2009," it added. It said the highest number of incidents in a single country occurred in France, with 164 attacks in 2014 compared to 141 the previous year. France has Europe's largest Jewish community, estimated at about 600,000. In Britain, 141 attacks were recorded, up from 95 in 2013 and Germany logged 76 in 2014, more than double the figure for 2013, said the report, which is published annually. "The overall feeling among many Jewish people is one of living in an intensifying anti-Jewish environment that has become not only insulting and threatening, but outright dangerous, and that they are facing an explosion of hatred towards them as individuals, their communities, and Israel, as a Jewish state," it said. It said one of the contributing factors was last summer's war in Gaza which sparked many protests, largely in Europe. dar/scw/hmw/mm
